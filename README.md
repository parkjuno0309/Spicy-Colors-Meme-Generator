# Spicy Colors Meme Generator
All memes are spicy, but every meme has a different level of spice. Our project allows the user to decide which meme is the spiciest based on their own spice scale. Designed as a tournament, the user can select the winner of each matchup to move on to the next round. The winner of the final matchup, crowned as the champion, will be displayed at the end.
